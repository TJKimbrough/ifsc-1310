   <h1>Final Reflection</h1>
   <p>  Web technologies and web design are not subjects that I was well versed in before the start of this semester. I had a faint understanding of what HTML and JavaScript were, but beyond that I was in the dark. I was pleasantly surprised at the start of the semester with how straightforward HTML syntax was. I found myslef getting the hang of it quickly, which then opened the door for me when we began learning CSS. It goes back to the idea of progressive enhancement. Building a website from the content out allows the site to be more accessible and be compatible regardless of the browser used to view it, but learning web design in the same order also provides understanding in the most efficient way possible. By the time we started working with CSS, I was able to see the selectors that were placed in the HTML code and how they would be used to target specific elements for design purposes. In addition to this, this class specifically utilized a direct approach to analyzing the value of elements on a website. I feel as though I can look at any website now and would be able to immediately flag components as good or bad. Mistakes that would have otherwise flown under my radar are now glaring problems I see when visiting the web.</p>
   <p>  With respect to the final SpaceX Dragon Project, I have personally learned how important a consistent and uniform HTML structure is when creating design elements. Once again, the application of progressive enhancement showing why it is effective. After showing my friend the site I had developed, his first thought was to ask why the pages were so static. Going into his examination, he knew that this was supposed to be a mock site for SpaceX, and as such he was expecting the page to be interactive or at the very least dynamic in its style. I used this feedback to recreate the JavaScript class demo to cycle through images at the bottom of each page. After showing him the site again, he was more inclined to believe it could actually be used as a website for SpaceX. Just the simple addition of some basic JavaScript completely revamped the page with a more modern and sophisticated design. This left me with my greatest regret from this class. It was simply too short. If we had another month or so, I feel as though I could have begun to better understand JavaScript and how to implement it in my work, creating an entirely new and fresh design gloss to my content.</p>
   <p>  As a whole, I feel I have learned a great deal over the course of this class. I feel confident in my ability to design a website and to analyze the target audience for the website to better tailor it for them. If I could change one thing about my approach to this class, it would be to take personal time to do my own research on CSS design elements and JavaScript to further my skills. This should be the case for any tech based course, as there are so many snippets of useful information that can be too specific to touch on over the course of a semester. While my confidence in my ability to develop a website is high, my confidence in my ability to develop anything with a higher degree of complexity than the projects we did throughout the semester is much less. Overall, this class has been informative in a pleasantly unique way. Rather than being taught the raw knowledge of what goes into creating a website, we were shown at each step how, why, and what to do to acheive our goals.</p>
