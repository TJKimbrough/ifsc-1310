<p>The Witch Queen, also known by the name Savathun, is one of the three primal gods of the Hive race in the world of Destiny. Having been teased since 2015 during the Taken King expansion, where players fought and killed her brother, Oryx, long time Destiny fans should be excited to finally clash with such a legendary enemy.</p>
<blockquote>""Who is Savathûn?" you ask. You already know, oh Guardian mine. I am your friend."<cite>— Savathûn to the Guardian</cite></blockquote>
<!--This div contains only the backstory of Savathun-->
<h2 id="story">The Story so Far...</h2>

<h3>Timeline of Events</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Crota, son of Oryx is killed on Earth's moon</li>
    <li>Oryx arrives in our solar System outside of Saturn</li>
    <li>Oryx is killed aboard his ship, after wreaking havoc in the asteroid belt</li>
    <li>Years later, the Dreaming City is discovered in the asteroid belt</li>
    <li>It is revealed that Savathun and Oryx had taken control of the Dreaming City in secret during Oryx's arrival</li>
    <li>The Queen of the asteroid belt wages war against Savathun's army</li>
    <li>Savathun's curse remains, trapping the Dreamin City in an endless loop</li>
    <li>A new threat approaches the solar system, provoking Savathun to act</li>
</ol>

<p>In the most recent story content available from Destiny, Savathun had infiltrated the ranks of the heroes are players have been fighting alongside under the guise of Osiris, a guardian of humanity that we had been made to beleive had narrowly escaped death investigating Hive activity on Earth's moon. It was recently revealed that he had been captured and replaced by Savathun so she could use Osiris as a bargaining chip to strike a deal. As it turns out, the third and youngest primal god of the Hive, Xivu Arath, has begun a war against her sister. Savathun has asked for players assistance in escaping her sister in exchange for the safe return og Osiris. After the end of the most current season of Destiny, we saw Savathun escape and keep her promise to return Osiris, but she escaped from us as well. </p>

<h2>What is to Come</h2>

<p>With what is known about the upcoming Witch Queen expansion, we see that Savathun has stolen the power of Light, the power source our players use to fight against the enemy factions attacking our solar system. For the first time in Destiny's history, players will be forced to fight enemies wielding the same power we have been using against them for over seven years. In addition to this new story, we have many new features added to the game, promising an all new experience to the game.</p>
