    <h1>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h1>
    <p>Progressive enhancement can be simply summarized as a content driven method for web development. The process for designing a website using progressive enhancement begins by using html to write out the base structure for content. Once the content has been structured, CSS can be added to make the content more visually appealling. Finally javascript can be added to finish design elements. Working this way allows websites to be more accessible across the web. Beginning with content allows the site to load independently from the browser used to view it by working from the content out without having concerns that javacript or CSS problems will not effect how the actual content is loaded.</p>
